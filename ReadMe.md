### üîπ Key Milestones

* **Java 5**: Massive language change with generics and annotations.
* **Java 8**: Functional programming era began with lambdas and streams.
* **Java 9**: Modularization of the JDK (Project Jigsaw).
* **Java 17 & 21**: LTS releases, ideal for production use with stable features.
* **Java 19‚Äì21**: Introduction and stabilization of **Virtual Threads** for better concurrency (Project Loom).

## Why java 8 is called 1.8 and Java 11 is called Java 11?

The reason **Java 8 is called both "Java 8" and "Java 1.8"**, while **Java 11 is just called "Java 11"**, is mainly due to a **change in versioning convention** made by Oracle and the Java community.

---

### üîπ The Old Versioning System (up to Java 8)

* Versions were named as **1.x** officially, but people commonly referred to them by just the major version.

* So:

    * Java 1.2 ‚Üí Java 2
    * Java 1.5 ‚Üí Java 5
    * Java 1.8 ‚Üí Java 8

* Internally (e.g., in `java -version` output or `classfile` versions), Java 8 is still referred to as **1.8**.

Example:

```bash
java -version
# Output:
# java version "1.8.0_341"
```

---

### üîπ The New Versioning System (from Java 9 onward)

* Starting with **Java 9**, Oracle switched to a simpler **semantic versioning** style:

    * **Java 9 = version 9**
    * **Java 10 = version 10**
    * **Java 11 = version 11**
    * And so on.

* No more ‚Äú1.x‚Äù ‚Äî now the internal and external version numbers **match**.

| Java 7       | Java 7         | 1.7              |
| Java 8       | Java 8         | 1.8              |
| Java 9+      | Java 9, 10...  | 9, 10...         |

## Overview of Java Release Cycle
   Starting with Java 9, Oracle introduced a new six-month release cycle. This means a new Java version is released twice a year. However, Long-Term Support (LTS) versions ‚Äî such as Java 8, 11, 17, and now 21 ‚Äî are released every few years and are supported for longer periods.


## Key Features of Each Java Version
### Java 8 (LTS)
Released in March 2014, Java 8 remains one of the most widely used versions of Java due to its stability and long support cycle. Key features include:

* **Lambda Expressions**: Enabled functional programming by allowing methods to be treated as first-class citizens.
  
* **Streams API**: Provides a powerful way to process collections of objects.
  
* **Default Methods**: Allowed interfaces to have method implementations, improving backward compatibility.
  
* **Optional Class**: Reduces null checks and helps prevent NullPointerException.

### Java 11 (LTS)
  Released in September 2018, Java 11 was the first LTS after Java 8 and marked the start of a modern Java. Key features include:

* **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters**: Use var in lambda expressions.
* **HTTP Client (Standard)**: New HttpClient API replaces HttpURLConnection, with support for HTTP/2 and WebSockets.
* **Nest-Based Access Control**: Improved encapsulation of nested classes.
* **Deprecation of Pack200**: Various libraries were deprecated and removed, encouraging modernization.

### Java 17 (LTS)
Released in September 2021, Java 17 is the most popular choice for LTS migration after Java 11. Key features include:

* **Sealed Classes**: Allows developers to define restricted class hierarchies.
* *Pattern Matching for instanceof**: Simplifies type checking.
* **Records**: Introduces compact syntax for immutable data classes.
* **Strong Encapsulation by Default**: Further improves module system enforcement introduced in Java 9.
* **Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator)**: Facilitates better native interoperation.

### Java 21 (LTS)
Released in September 2023, Java 21 brings significant new features and improvements:

* **Pattern Matching for Switch**: Adds a more expressive and safer switch.
* **Record Patterns**: Enables pattern matching for record deconstruction.
* **Virtual Threads (Project Loom)**: Lightweight threads to simplify writing high-throughput, scalable applications.
* **Scoped Values**: An enhancement in Project Loom to enable flexible state passing in threads.
* **Structured Concurrency (Incubator)**: Provides a model for concurrent tasks with lifecycles bound to parent tasks.
* **Foreign Function & Memory API (Final)**: Finalized API for efficient interoperation with native code. 

## Performance Improvements
Java 11 and beyond have introduced substantial performance improvements, particularly for garbage collection, startup time, and memory usage.

* **Java 8**: Uses Parallel GC by default.
* **Java 11**: Introduces Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) and G1GC as the default GC for low-latency applications.
* **Java 17**: G1GC and ZGC have been further optimized.
* **Java 21**: Includes enhancements in Virtual Threads and improved garbage collection algorithms.

## New Language Features
A quick comparison of language feature improvements:

## Tooling and API Enhancements
* **Java 8**: Introduced some of the most widely adopted features like Lambda and Stream APIs.
* **Java 11**: Introduced improvements like the new HttpClient and removed tools like javaws.
* **Java 17**: Enhanced APIs like RandomGenerator, Stream, and Optional. Sealed Classes and Record Types became permanent.
* **Java 21**: Includes finalized Foreign Function & Memory API and new APIs for structured concurrency. 
   
## Deprecations and Removed Features
Each newer version of Java deprecates older features and removes unsupported APIs:

* **Java 11**: Removed deprecated modules like java.xml.ws and tools like javaws.
* **Java 17**: Deprecated the Security Manager and finalized the removal of older APIs like Nashorn JavaScript Engine.
* **Java 21**: Continues this trend by further deprecating outdated features, improving the overall performance and security of the language. 

## Migration Considerations
Migrating from Java 8 or 11 to newer versions like Java 17 or 21 offers significant advantages in terms of performance and feature sets, but it can come with challenges:

* **Dependency Compatibility**: Some libraries or frameworks might not yet be compatible with newer Java versions.
* **Newer APIs**: Adopting new APIs like the HTTP Client or Record Types may require code changes.
* **Garbage Collection and Performance Tuning**: Newer versions bring optimized GCs, but they may require tuning based on application needs.

## Conclusion
* **Java 8**: Still widely used but lacks modern features.
* **Java 11**: A stable LTS release, offering modern features while still being compatible with legacy systems.
* **Java 17**: The most recommended LTS version due to its balance of modern features and long-term support.
* **Java 21**: The latest LTS version, bringing cutting-edge features like Virtual Threads and Structured Concurrency.

* Choosing the right Java version depends on your application‚Äôs specific needs, but moving towards the latest LTS versions like Java 17 or 21 will future-proof your application and provide performance improvements.
